# Quick Start: Building the UI Application

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Install Qt (5 minutes)

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install qt@6
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@6/bin:$PATH"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qtcreator
```

**Windows:**
Download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download and install Qt 6.x

### Step 2: Create Basic UI Structure (30 minutes)

I can help you create:
1. Basic Qt MainWindow
2. Viewport widget to display renders
3. Integration with your existing renderer

### Step 3: Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Full Qt Application (Recommended)**
- Professional UI
- Better for end users
- More development time

**Option B: ImGui Quick Prototype**
- Faster to develop
- Great for tools/editors
- Less polished

## What I Can Help You Build

1. **Basic Qt Application Skeleton** - Main window, menus, viewport
2. **Render Integration** - Connect your existing renderer to UI
3. **Scene Editor** - Add/remove objects, edit properties
4. **Material Editor** - Visual material creation
5. **Real-time Preview** - Low-quality preview while editing

---

## Recommendation

Start with **Qt** because:
- Your project specification mentions professional quality
- Better user experience
- Industry-standard (like Unity/Unreal)
- Good learning experience

Would you like me to:
1. Create the initial Qt project structure?
2. Set up the CMakeLists.txt for Qt?
3. Create the basic MainWindow and ViewportWidget classes?
4. Integrate your existing renderer with the UI?

Let me know which you'd like to start with!
